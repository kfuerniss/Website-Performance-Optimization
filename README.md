## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
https://kfuerniss.github.io/Website-Performance-Optimization

STEPS TAKEN TO OPTIMIZE

- Cleaned up HTML tagging
- Added semantic tags
- changed the Google Analytics script to async
- Relocated JS
- Added the media tag to the print.css sheet
- Removed googleapis link
- Compressed all images
- Inlined Style CSS 

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

STEPS TAKEN TO OPTIMIZE

- removed declared variable scrollTop from updatePositions function

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
